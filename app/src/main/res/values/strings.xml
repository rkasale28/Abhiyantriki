    <string name="kjsce">The K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering was established in 1983 at
        Somaiya, Vidyavihar. It offers 4-year bachelors degree courses in five diverse departments.
        KJSCE is an Autonomous college affiliated to the University of Mumbai and is recognized by
        the All India Council for Technical Education. The college hosts three huge festivals:
        Abhiyantriki, Skream, and Symphony</string>
    <string name="abhiyantriki">Abhiyantriki is the annual technical festival of K.J. Somaiya College
        of Engineering. Previously, organizations like DRDO, BARC, ISRO, DAE have participated in
        the fest along with prominent personalities such as the late Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, R
        Chidambaram, Abhas Mitra etc. It is a culmination of the brightest young minds coming in to
        compete in the various technical activities that take place during the two day long
        celebration.</string>
    <string name="year_98">Abhiyantriki introduced as an individual, standalone festival of technical
    grandeur and pomp.</string>
    <string name="year_08">Funds collected this year were all donated for the rehabilitation of the
        flood struck Bihar and Abhiyantriki rose in popularity with extensive media coverage.</string>
    <string name="year_09">KJSCE marks 25 years since its inauguration, and the closing ceremony of
        Abhiyantriki was ornamented by the presence of late Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.</string>
    <string name="year_14">The maiden year for Start-up and Auto Expo, Abhiyantriki this year also
        encompassed Rohit Suri, the Jaguar India CEO as one of the keynote speakers.</string>
    <string name="year_16">Abhiyantriki extended by a day, now was a two-day long fest with its
        flagship event being a technical exhibition presided over by ISRO.</string>
    <string name="year_17">Attending to the likes of DRDO, DAE and BARC, Abhiyantriki garnered a
        running footfall of over 15,000 for the first time in its history!</string>
    <string name="pubg">The PUBG fever has infected everyone and with a game as addictive and
        intense as this, it’d be a shame for it to not be a part of Abhiyantriki ‘18. It’s time to
        loot all the crates in sight and face the terrors of Pochinki as you run away from the
        dreaded blue circle of death.</string>

        at no cost!</string>
    <string name="meme">Memes have become a part and parcel of a student’s life. And for engineers,
        memes are a stress buster during exams. An early morning cup of tea with some amusing memes
        to go through makes one’s day lively. And Abhiyantriki 2018 has something exhilarating for

        and pave its way towards victory. Have you got what it takes to manage a team and lead it to

    <string name="cs">From time immemorial, one thing that describes engineers the best would be the
        legendary FPS, Counter Strike. It’s time to Rush B and come out of your congested, damp and
        clammy hostel rooms and go guns blazing in a tournament to decide who has got the eagle eyed
        vision worthy of the Golden Glock.</string>
    <string name="CastleMath">With the lectures frying your brains to a crisp with the arrays of
        Epsilons and Gammas, it is time to bring math outside the classroom. With this exciting event
        presented by Team Emfinity, we hope all the zealots of math bring out their inner fangirl.

    <string name="parvaahTitle">
        The social initiative of K.J. Somaiya College of engineering, named Parvaah, works each year
        with a purpose of providing to the underprivileged and oppressed.
        This time around, Parvaah is on a mission to establish a “Zero Waste Community,” wherein constant
        efforts are being made for reducing, reusing and recycling the waste generated and contributing back to the society.
    </string>
    <string name="parvaahSchoolAwareness">
        It is said ‘The students of today are the future of tomorrow’. Realising this, Parvaah plans on visiting schools in Mumbai and teach the students the basic principles of a zero waste community. It’s an attempt to educate the students as well as the staff of the school about the need to go zero waste. Along with this, we also aim at transforming the schools into a zero waste locality. Instilling a sense of responsibility in the students towards managing their waste will go a long way in realising our goal of a cleaner Mumbai.
    </string>
    <string name="parvaahPlasticECollectionDrive">
    Keeping in mind the perils caused by plastic and e-waste, Parvaah has decided to conduct a collection drive for these hazardous items. The plastic and e-waste which is collected will then be sent for recycling thus ensuring there is no harm caused towards the environment. E-waste contains heavy metals like cadmium, lead, copper, and chromium that can contaminate the environment while plastic, on the other hand, is made from toxic compounds known to cause illness, and because it is meant for durability, it is not biodegradable. Constituting a major chunk of our waste, a proper and efficient disposal of these items is the need of the hour.    </string>
    <string name="parvaahGanpatiVisarjanCleanup">
    The festive season of Ganesh Chaturthi is one which is celebrated with great pride and enthusiasm all across the state. But what follows at the end of 11 days is a beach replete of floral waste and half-broken idols. To overcome this, Parvaah has decided to organize a beach clean-up at the Girgaum Chowpatty on the day after Ganesh Visarjan to clear up the beach of all its waste. We plan on associating with other college students from that area and make this a ground-breaking youth moment. Similarly, we would also be spreading awareness about celebrating an eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav in the weeks leading to the festival.

    <string name="parvaahSignalShala">
    Signal Shala is an innovative concept initialized by Samarth Bharat Vyaspith along with Thane Municipal Corporation, to provide education to underprivileged children living on signals in Thane. Situated in a small container below a bridge, the main aim of Signal Shala is to make these kids capable of adjusting themselves with the mainstream world. We at Parvaah plan on spreading awareness about Zero Waste with the help of these kids and also teach them simple ways to treat their waste. As signals witness a frequent number of vehicles, we aim to use this medium to make the people aware of the basic habits they can follow to effectively manage their waste. We at Parvaah believe that only when it is a collective effort of all its citizens can a city truly make great progress in achieving a goal.
    </string>
    <string name="parvaahSecretSanta">
    On the occasion of Christmas, Parvaah plans on visiting an orphanage and celebrate with the kids. To further the joy, we would also be distributing toys, goodies, and sweets among the kids. This would be followed by playing games with the children, interacting with them and ensuring that everyone has a smile on his or her face.
    </string>
    <string name="parvaah_Marathon">
    Parvaah plans to organize a marathon to raise awareness about waste crisis. The marathon is proposed to take place in the Ghatkopar area of suburban Mumbai. We would also be starting a fundraiser event through this marathon.
